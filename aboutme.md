    <p>I'm broadly interested in ML backend/infrastructure development, computer graphics and point cloud processing.</p>
    <p>During my graduate studies, my research focused on compressing point cloud data using a Transformer-based deep entropy model.</p>
    <p>Currently, I work as a Software Engineer on the TikTok E-commerce Recommendation Team, where I focus on model infrastructure development.</p>
